# Indian-Measurement-for-Clothes---Prediction-Model

Whenever we go out to buy any clothing item, we always come across measurements which are either in the US standard, the EUR standard or some other prevalant standard.
The main objective for this project was to come up with a standardized Indian measurement system which would be, in the future, accepted as the default standard for all clothing brands in India.

I employed a basic multi - variable regression model in R which accepts parameters such as the person's height, age,. Fit preference, Figure Type, Body Shape, Arm Shape, Abdomen, Hip and other parameters to comeup with a 6 scale measurement standard.
